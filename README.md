Bibbit
======

Bibbit is a small client-side Progressive Web App for serving an array of cocktail recipes from a Git repository using the [Cooklang](https://cooklang.org/) format.

The concept is to make it simple, taggable, eventually searchable, and updatable via Git.

## Technology
This is written in TypeScript and uses Bootstrap. The goal is to minimize NPM dependencies and make it run as lightly as possible locally.

## Name
Comes from the _In taberna quando sumus_ segment of _Carmina Burana_
